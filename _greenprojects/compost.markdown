My experience with compost is really more of a saga that would probably be best described in a series of blog posts rather than a single project, but I'll attempt to cover my most recent attempts at perfecting my hot compost pile and summarize some lessons learned. 

For a long time, I did 'vermicompost'(worm compost) which is a fun and easy way to get started composting household scraps. You can even keep a vermicompost bin indoors (though I never did-- I always kept my outside). To create my worm bin, I stacked a few large rubbermaid tubs and drilled holes for drainage, except for the bottom-most tub which I left hole-less to keep the compost tea. Worms love love love eating leftover human foods and kitchen scraps, especially anything soft. They also love shredded paper and cardboard along with darkness, and moisture. I combined those 4 ingredients (food waste, paper, darkness, damp) in my rubbermaid bins and regularly generated lots of worm compost which is a great soil amendment. 

There are 2 reasons why I wanted to graduate beyond worm compost to a hot composting system:
1. Meat & Pathogens - Worms cannot break down some tougher materials like bone and don't do as well with meats and fats. 
2. Weeds - Worms eat seeds and then pass them through their bodies so weed seeds will still be able to sprout. Not great if you're spreading worm compost on your garden!

Enter hot compost -- seeds and pathogens are inactivated because of the hotter internal temperatures of the pile & all organic matter will eventually break down (though it make take several passes through the hot composting system)

I had a lot more time at home at the beginning of the pandemic so I decided to re-up my compost game and switch from my old trusty worm bin system to a hot composting. For a while, I used some strapped together cardboard boxes (truly the world's jankiest compost setup), but recently I invested in this $10 geobin.

So far, so good, although the temperature is not quite as high as I would like. True *hot* compost should be at about 130degF. Since moving to the geobin, my compost is sitting below 100F.

Having experimented with this for a few months, I'm pretty sure I know the problem(s).

<h1> Lesson Learned #1: You almost always need more brown </h1>
In the compost world, it's imperative to get the right ratio between "greens" and "browns"-- green material and brown material. Browns are anything made primarily out of *carbon*-- generally anything that was alive and is now dead and fibrous. Things like woods, stalks, dried grass, and paper and cardboard. Generally people complain that compost "smells" because there is too much fresh, goopy green stuff like kitchen waste and not enough brown stuff to balance it out. There's a lot of ratios involved depending on the organic matter to get the exact right ratio of green to brown, but a very general rule of thumb is 1:1. 

In my case, however, there's way too much brown stuff and not enough green stuff, which I believe is the primary reason why the pile is staying relatively cool.

<h1> Lesson Learned #2: Pile is not big enough!</h1>
Try as I might to make a small hot compost bin work, the ideal size is really 1 cubic meter and there's no getting around it. A smaller pile will not hold the heat as well. The geobin helps with this because you can set the diameter to exactly 

For a cyclindrical bin like this, that's about 40" in diameter and 40" tall. My pile is definitely not that high at the moment and I also need to check the dimension of the cylinder. The nice thing about the geobin is that it's adjustable to a variety of diameters. 

<h1> Lesson Learned #3: Dry spots </h1>
Compost needs to be wet, but not too wet like a wrung out spong. Not only that, it needs to be wet throughout. If you spray water on a pile once it's built, it will sheet off the sides without actually penetrating the pile. As you can see from the "browns" photo above, my pile is very dry. Time to get to work!
