I made this cool acquaponics system with my boyfriend's old fish tank and pump, some scrap wood and many trips to home depot plumbing dept for PVC.

Brief primer on acquaponics: fish on the bottom; plants on top. Water from the fish tank is pumped up to a gravel bed on top. The nitrogen from the fish poo is sucked up and feeds the plants which helps filter the water. The water drains back down to the fish tank below and thus the cycle continues. 


The design incorporates an awesome device called a bell siphon so that water can periodically flood and drain the gravel bed. This allows the plants to soak up the nutrients but also gives time for their roots to dry out.

Here's a wacky video I made of the setup awhile back:
