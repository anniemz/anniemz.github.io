I learned a TON doing this project and went from writing casual scripts for data processing in python to actually using the full capabilities and understanding how to write a package. From debugging certain aspects related to package versioning, I also learned the value of using contained environments.

Another lesson learned-- a few weeks after scraping all the data that I needed, I discovered that Alameda County has a **wonderful** website called data.acgov.org where you can download and access many treasure troves of publicly available data. I found this [dataset](https://data.acgov.org/datasets/b55c25ae04fc47fc9c188dbbfcd51192_0?showData=true) which would have eliminated parts 2&3 of my project and enabled me to fast-forward to mapping and data analysis. While I did research ways to find the data I needed, still more research could have saved me a LOT of time. 

Lastly, in looking for images for this project, I discovered an amazing article-- [Mapping California's Prop. 13 winners and losers, down to your neighborhood](http://projects.scpr.org/prop-13/)-- that does some of the same analysis and mapping, though through a slightly different lens.
