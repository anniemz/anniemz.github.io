 I set out to do this project because I constantly complain to anyone who will listen about the evils of Prop 13 in California. I recently heard it described as the "third rail of California politics." For those who may not live in California or be familiar with it, [Proposition 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13) is a ballot measure that was passed by California voters in the late 1970's to limit property tax increases in a state that had rapidly become more populated and more expensive in the previous decades. 

 In most areas of the United States, property taxes are based on a small percentage (1-3%) of the "assessed" value of the property. As the market changes and houses go up in price, so do the property taxes. The intent of Prop 13 was noble: to limit property tax increases to prevent gentrification and rising home values from pushing people out of their homes and neighbhorhoods. The mechanism by which this was done was to limit the increase of the assesment each year to match inflation, maxing out at 2%. 

 The losers from Prop 13 are local governments, services, and schools that depend on property taxes for funding. The ultimate effect of the change was fairly diastrous for local governments which had to slash their budgets and in particular for schools. Schools, even with some added "equilization" funds from the state, have struggled. Part of the inspiration for this project, was this [fantastic analysis of school funding per student by school district from NPR](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem). You can see from their analysis in the graphic below that even in the Bay Area, where homes often sell for $1Million+, funding per student is either below or well below the national average.

The "winners" from Prop 13 (if you could think of it that way, arguably we all lose a little bit), are folks paying 70's era property taxes on their houses with 2020 values. While Prop 13 was designed to protect low income people from getting displaced, it has also helped every home owner, and not necessarily just low income people. Higher income incumbents also benefit greatly. People are also disincentivized not to move so as not to lose their low property tax bill.

As in all of the Bay Area, Oakland is experiencing a white hot housing market and thus a lot of housing turnover. I suspect many new property owners assesed home values are close to what they paid. I set out to do this project because I was curious to see how closely assesed home values track with market rates for housing and if certain communities or parts of Oakland are benefiting more than others. Basically is the measure really helping those it was designed to protect? Are certain home-owners benefitting more than others? 

To answer these questions, I decided to do a small analysis of assessed housing values vs market rate to compare different neighborhoods in Oakland, where I live.
