	 Hi! I’m Annie. I'm a mechanical engineer and wannabe data scientist. Ever since I was a kid tearing pages out of Architectural Digest, I have loved buildings, design and architecture. I’m also passionate about ecology and sustainability. Recently, I completed a course on data science.  This website lives at the intersection of those 3 realms and is a repository of my past, present and future projects.
