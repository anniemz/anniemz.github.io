	 Hi, I’m Annie. I'm a mechanical engineer and wannabe data scientist. Ever since I was a kid tearing pages out of architecture magazines, I have loved buildings, design and architecture. I’m a passionate environmentalist working to lessen the impact we humans have on our planet. Recently, I completed a course on data science and machine learning.  This website lives at the intersection of those 3 realms [design,sustainability,data] and is a repository of my past, present and future projects.
